# url-shortener
A project made using Flask, Hashid, and Python 3.8.

This projects main purpose was for me to compare the Flask framework to the Django framework.
After using Flask, I have decided that Django is more versatile and will be continuing to workwith Django.
This program follows basic Flask tutorials and protocols.
